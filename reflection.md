Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
The class name is HarryPotter, which is meant to represent wizards. Harry can walk and fly around grabbing items and examining them. Harry can use those items, throw it away, and shrink or grow in height. As Harry flies or examins items, Harry's exp will increase. We can print out both Harry's inventory and EXP. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I created a Harry constructor, which creates 'Harry' and takes Harry's height and current position as its parameters. I also created a land() method, which makes Harry stop flying, a printInventory() method, which prints out Harry's inventory, and a getEXP method, which returns Harry's current EXP. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Everything went well, as there wasn't anything that caused a problem in the code. I hope I could implement this program to create a fun game in the future. I would like to tell them to be creative as much as possible!
